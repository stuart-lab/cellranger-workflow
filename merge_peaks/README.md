# Extracting outputs from CellRanger 
Run this workflow after "outs" generated from CellRanger to merge all the data into 1 Seurat Object.

## Note
1) If following since start, accessions.txt should be a list of ALL SRR numbers across experiments to be extracted. **needs to be generated by user 
2) config.yaml "wd" should be your working directory.
3) The name of the rds file can be changed in the R code to your liking.
4) The metadata$dataset will have the information on which dataset a cell is from.
5) The names of the output files between CellRangerARC and ATAC is different; use the right pipeline.

## For successful extraction, directory structure must be as follows
```
.
├── extract.snakefile
├── config.yaml
├── mergePeaks_ARC.R
├── accessions.txt
├── Dataset1
│   ├── SRR1
│   ├── SRR2
│   ├── SRR3
│   └── SRR4
└── Dataset2
    ├── SRR5
    ├── SRR6
    ├── SRR7
    └── SRR8

```

**The following new folders will be created within the same directory**

```
...
├── bed
├── filtered_matrix
├── metrics
└── frags

```

mergePeaks_ARC.R can be run now - it will output an ".rds" file with everything merged.
