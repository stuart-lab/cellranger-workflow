MissingOutputException in rule prefetch_atac in file /charonfs/scratch/users/astar/gis/stufrancis/snakemake_tutorial/best_snakefile.snakefile, line 16:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
atac_seq/SRR17909502/SRR17909502.sra (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
