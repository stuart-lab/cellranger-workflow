MissingOutputException in rule fastq_dump_rna in file /charonfs/scratch/users/astar/gis/stufrancis/atlas_snakefiles_faster/get_rna.snakefile, line 26:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
rna_seq/SRR17909494/SRR17909494_1.fastq (missing locally, parent dir contents: SRR17909494_4.fastq, SRR17909494.sra, SRR17909494_3.fastq)
rna_seq/SRR17909494/SRR17909494_2.fastq (missing locally, parent dir contents: SRR17909494_4.fastq, SRR17909494.sra, SRR17909494_3.fastq)
Removing output files of failed job fastq_dump_rna since they might be corrupted:
rna_seq/SRR17909494/SRR17909494_3.fastq, rna_seq/SRR17909494/SRR17909494_4.fastq
Shutting down, this might take some time.
